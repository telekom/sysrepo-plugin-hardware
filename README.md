The goal of this project is to create a Debian implementation of the IETF-Hardware YANG module disregarding any SNMP approach.

## About this component

A sysrepo plugin for the IETF-Hardware YANG module [RFC8348](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8348)

## Development

The full development progress can be found in the [documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Dependencies
```
libyang compiled with libyang-cpp
sysrepo compiled with sysrepo-cpp
libsensors4-dev
lm-sensors
pthreads
```

### Build

The plugin is built as a shared library using the [MESON build system](https://mesonbuild.com/) and is required for building the plugin.

```bash
apt install meson ninja-build cmake pkg-config
```

The plugin install location is the `{prefix}` folder, the `libietf-hardware-plugin.so` should be installed over to the `plugins` folder from the sysrepo installation (e.g. the sysrepo install location for the bash commands below is `/opt/sysrepo`)\
Build by making a build directory (i.e. build/), run meson in that dir, and then use ninja to build the desired target.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/sysrepo/lib/sysrepo/plugins
meson --prefix="/opt/sysrepo/lib/sysrepo/plugins" ./build
ninja -C ./build
```

### Installation

Meson installs the shared-library in the `{prefix}`.

```bash
ninja install -C ./build
```
